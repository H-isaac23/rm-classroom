# rm-classroom

## What it is

*rm-classroom* is a chrome extension project made by a student because some teachers forget to archive classes even after the semester ends, which clogs up the classroom of a student resulting into unnecessary inconvenience.
Honestly perplexed why Google hasn't implemented a hide function yet.

## Status

Extension is made available only to Google Classroom. Next stage is hiding a single classroom, followed by hiding multiple classrooms.
